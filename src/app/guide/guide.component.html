  <h2>🎯 Objective</h2>
  <p>Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a strategic twist on the classic game, using a grid of 9 mini tic-tac-toe boards arranged into a larger 3x3 board. The goal is to win three mini-boards in a row on the big board—just like regular tic-tac-toe, but with more depth.</p>

  <h2>📜 Rules Overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Start:</strong> Player X goes first and can move in any cell of any mini-board.</li>
    <li><strong>Next Move Direction:</strong> The cell played sends the next player to the corresponding mini-board. For example, a move in the bottom-left cell sends the next player to the bottom-left board.</li>
    <li><strong>Mini-Board Wins:</strong> Players win a mini-board by aligning 3 of their marks. Won boards are locked.</li>
    <li><strong>Full/Won Mini-Boards:</strong> If a player is sent to a full or won board, they can move anywhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Game Victory:</strong> Win the game by winning 3 mini-boards in a line—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>⚖️ Tie-Breaker Rule</h2>
  <p>If all mini-boards are filled and no player has 3 in a row on the large board, the player who has won the most mini-boards wins the game.</p>
  <p>If both players have an equal number of mini-board wins, the game ends in a draw.</p>

  <h2>🧠 Engine Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Live Evaluations:</strong> The engine displays numerical evaluations for each legal move, giving insight into how strong each option is.</li>
    <li><strong>Step Navigation:</strong> Use arrow buttons to go backward and forward through the move history and explore alternate lines.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔁 Recap</h2>
  <p>Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is simple to learn yet challenging to master. This engine makes it easier to explore positions, evaluate strategies, and enjoy this advanced variant of a classic favorite.</p>
